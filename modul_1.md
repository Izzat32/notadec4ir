# Modul 1

Dynamic Remotely Operated Navigation Equipment
* fly remotely (of course)
* optionally autonomously/unmanned

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
* can be flied remotely
* supposed to be autonomous (because unmanned)

## 4 types of drones:
* Multi rotor:
    * Lebih dari 1 rotor
 * Contoh:

    * Tricopter
    * Quadcopter
    * Hexacopter
    * Octocopter


Single rotor:
* 1 jela üòí

* Contoh: 
    * Fixed wing:
        * single rotor on back or front, similar to planes ‚úàÔ∏è

    * Fixed wing hybrid:
        * similar to fixed wing but is multi rotor
  
            * Contoh:
            VTOL (Vertical Takeoff Landing)

## Pros and cons:

### Multi-rotor:

Pros:

* Easier to control and maneuver
* Take off and land vertically
* Can hover
* Stable

Cons:
* Shorter flight time because it uses more electricity due to having to run more rotors
* Shorter range

Single rotor helicopter:

Pros:
* Able to hover vertically in the air
* Strong and durable üí™
* Longer flight time (gas powered)
* Heavy payload capability

Cons:
* Harder to fly
* Expensive
* Complexity built
* Dangerous (heavy spinning blade)

### Fixed wing hybrid (VTOL)

Pros:
* can take off and land vertically ‚úÖ
* No need for a long runway as it can take off and land vertically
* Able to hover
* Can carry heavier payloads
* Stable

Cons:
* More complex
* More power needed (again, because of multiple rotors)
* Shorter flight time constrained by batteries

### Fixed wing drones:

Pros:
* Simple structure
* Low maintainance
* Longer flight times
* Longer range
* Lower power usage

Cons:
* Runway or launcher needed for take-off and landing
* No hovering


## Applications for drones and UAVs
* Deliver goods and supplies
* Filming
* Building structures
* Surveying
* Rescuing
* Farming


## Bagaimana nak mula?

1. Simulator (ada kat dec4ir.com)
2. Menduduki kursus dron
3. Guna dron jenis kecil (kurang dari 110mm) dan ringan (kurang dari 250g). Aq rasa dorg suggest pakai dron FPV ü§î
4. Berteman
5. Sentiasa menjaga keselamatan dan mematuhi undang¬≤
